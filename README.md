# AdventOfCode2015
My solutions for the 2015 Advent of Code, written in Java.

## What is Advent of Code?
The about page of https://adventofcode.com/2015/about describes AoC as, "Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."

## Project Structure
Each day is contained within a single folder. Inside the folder is the input for the day as well as one or two Java files (depending on the problem) containing the solution.

## Version
This code is written in Java 9.
